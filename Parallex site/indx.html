            <h2>Ocean</h2>
            <p>An ocean is a vast expanse of saline water, constituting a significant portion of the Earth's hydrosphere. Covering approximately 71% of the Earth's surface, oceans encompass about 361 million square kilometers, forming a continuous body of water that is subdivided into major oceans and smaller seas. Much of the ocean floor plunges to depths exceeding 3,000 meters (9,800 feet), with over half of the oceanic area falling into this category. The salinity of seawater, averaging around 35 parts per thousand (ppt) or 3.5%, varies slightly but typically falls within the range of 30 to 38 ppt. While traditionally viewed as distinct entities, the various oceans are interconnected, forming a unified global ocean or World Ocean. This concept highlights the fundamental interconnectedness of oceanic systems and is pivotal in the field of oceanography, emphasizing the continuous exchange and circulation of water and substances across the vast expanse of the world's oceans.</p>

            <h2>Lakes</h2>
            <p>
                A lake, derived from the Latin word "lacus," is a geological feature, characterized as a body of liquid confined within a basin on the surface of a planetary body. Typically, lakes are stationary or move at a slow pace. On Earth, a body of water qualifies as a lake if it meets certain criteria: it must be inland, not connected to the ocean, larger and deeper than a pond, and fed by a river. Aside from Earth, the only other celestial body known to possess lakes is Titan, Saturn's largest moon. Titan's lakes consist primarily of ethane, possibly mixed with methane. It remains uncertain whether Titan's lakes are replenished by rivers, although evidence of river channels on Titan's surface suggests a dynamic hydrological system.</p>

            <h2>Ponds</h2>
            <p>A pond is a body of standing water, either natural or human-made, that is usually smaller than a lake. A wide variety of human-made bodies of water are classified as ponds, including water gardens designed for aesthetic ornamentation, fish ponds designed for commercial fish breeding, and solar ponds designed to store thermal energy. Ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams via current speed. While currents in streams are easily observed, ponds and lakes possess thermally driven micro-currents and moderate wind driven currents. These features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features, such as stream pools and tide pools.</p>

            <h2>Rivers</h2>
            <p>
                A river is a natural watercourse, typically carrying freshwater, that flows in a defined path toward an ocean, lake, sea, or another river. In some instances, a river may terminate by flowing into the ground or completely drying up before reaching another body of water. Various terms such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill are used interchangeably to refer to small rivers, with no strict criteria defining what qualifies as a river. Regional differences often dictate the naming conventions for such water bodies, as seen with the term "Burn" in Scotland and North-east England. While it's commonly understood that rivers are larger than creeks, there's no universal rule, leading to ambiguity in terminology.
                
                Rivers play a crucial role in the hydrological cycle, serving as integral components of Earth's water systems. They collect water from precipitation through surface runoff, groundwater recharge, springs, and the melting of natural ice and snowpacks, including glaciers. As they flow, rivers transport sediment, nutrients, and organic matter, shaping landscapes and supporting diverse ecosystems along their courses. Understanding rivers is essential for managing water resources, mitigating the impacts of floods and droughts, and preserving the ecological health of riparian environments.</p>
